# odin-recipes
The Odin Project: Recipe project
 
This assignment is to practice html with its various tags and their uses. 
By the end of it I should have made a website with working links to 4 recipes
with a specific format. These will all also have images attached to them.

For this project my commit messages wil be varrying slightly as I find the way
that I like doing them. By the end of the project there should be more consistancy
from message to message conserning the same or similar changes made to multiple 
pages.
