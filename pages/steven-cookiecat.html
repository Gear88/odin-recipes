      Originally from the show Steven Universe Cookie cats are a brand of icecream sandwich. When steven finds
      out that the product is being discontinued he gets rather upset and through that turmoil finds out that 
      he got some of his mothers powers. While these sandwiches wont give you mistical powers they are pretty 
      tasty.

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine flour and cocoa powder in a small bowl. Using a fine mesh sieve, sift 
        the flour mixture onto a piece of parchment paper. 
      </li>
      <li>
        In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the butter, sugar, baking soda 
        and salt for 5 minutes until the mixture is well combined and fluffy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the vanilla and milk in a small bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        With the mixer running on a low speed, tip 1/3 of the dry ingredients, then 
        half of the milk. Using a spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl, then add 
        another 1/3 of the dry ingredients and the remaining milk and the vanilla. 
        Scrape the bowl down once more and add the remaining dry ingredients, mix until 
        just combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the dough out to 4 mm thickness between two pieces of parchment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the top layer of parchment and cut out the cookie design using a cutter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the cookies to a large rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake at 350 for 7-10 minutes, just until the cookies look dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the cookies to cool on the sheet tray until completely cool.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>No-Churn Vanilla Ice Cream</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine all ingredients in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together using an electric mixer until very thick, about 3-4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the cream mixture onto one side of a parchment-lined baking sheet. 
        Reserve in the refrigerator until the other flavor is prepared. 
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>No-Churn Strawberry Ice Cream</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Trim the tops and slice the strawberries in half. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the strawberries to a quarter-rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast at 350 Â°F for 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the strawberries from the oven and let them cool on the sheet tray for 15 minutes. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Puree the roasted strawberries in a food processor or blender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain the mixture and reserve the liquid. Discard the excess pulp. Set puree aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine all ingredients, except for the strawberry puree, in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together using an electric mixer until very thick, about 3-4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold in the strawberry puree.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the cream mixture onto the other side of the parchment lined baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once both sides of the sheet tray are covered, smooth the top with a large offset spatula. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the surface of the ice cream mixtures with a piece of parchment paper. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrap the whole sheet tray in plastic wrap and freeze until solid, 24 hours.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cookie Cat Assembly</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the ice cream using the same size cookie cutter used for cutting the cookie dough. 
        Place the ice cream layer on top of one of the cooled cookies. Make sure the ice cream 
        layer is aligned with the cookie.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place another cookie on top and freeze the sandwich for 2-4 hours, or until completely firm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the freezer and enjoy immediately. 
      </li>
    </ol>
