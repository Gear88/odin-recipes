      Originally from the show Steven Universe Cookie cats are a brand of icecream sandwich. When steven finds
      out that the product is being discontinued he gets rather upset and through that turmoil finds out that 
      he got some of his mothers powers. While these sandwiches wont give you mistical powers they are pretty 
      tasty.
