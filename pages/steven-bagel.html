      Originally from the show Steven Universe these bagel sandwiches are the perfect thing to distract some
      crystal critters, or snack on durring the long boat ride back home. The original creator of this recipe 
      and myself both think that the best bagel is one made at home with this recipe. That being said feel free
      to still make the sandwich with storebought bagels if you need too. Since there is more than one version of
      the sandwich in the show there are 3 diffrent versions listed below. Be sure to check out the original recipe
      for an additional take on the recipe.

    <h1>Method</h1>

    <h2>Bagels</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Into the bowl of a stand mixer goes 250 grams of bread flour, 1 tsp active dry yeast, and 350 grams 
        (12 ¼ ounces) of water. Combine with a spatula into a paste. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at 
        room temperature for 2-3 hours until it is bubbling. Set bowl in stand mixer with dough hook attachment. 
        In a separate bowl, combine 400 grams bread flour, 25 grams granulated sugar, 25 grams of diastatic malt 
        powder, and 10 grams kosher salt. Mix dry ingredients together. Start stand mixer at a low speed and add 
        in the dry mix, one spoonful at a time, to create bagel dough. Once all dry ingredients have been added, 
        let dough knead for 20 minutes. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit in fridge for 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the dough is sitting, grease a half size sheet pan, line with parchment paper, and grease top of 
        paper as well. Cut the dough and form into balls that weigh 65 grams. For the balls, tuck the dough 
        underneath themselves, making them smooth and round. Cover with a damp towel in between formations 
        because the dough develops a skin very quickly. Cover the balls with plastic wrap and place in the fridge
        for another 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from fridge and gently make a hole in the middle and stretch out by circling the middle with two 
        fingers. Once all are in bagel form, cover again with plastic wrap, and let sit out for 20 minutes before 
        putting in the fridge overnight for at least 24 hours. 
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pot, pour in about 1 ½ gallons of water, 1 Tbsp barley syrup, and 2 tsp baking soda. After that 
        has dissolved and the water is at a boil, put in bagels and boil for 60 seconds on each side. Then, flip 
        onto cooling rack smooth side up to drain for about one minute. If you want to add a flavor to your bagels, 
        now is the time to do it (see everything instructions in original recipe).
      </li>
      <li>
        Then put the bagels on a lightly greased parchment paper lined baking sheet and put in oven for 15 minutes 
        at 425°F, rotating the tray once at 7 minutes and flipping the bagels once at 13 minutes. 
      </li>
      <li>
        For “everything” seasoning, in a small bowl combine some onion granules, garlic flakes, white sesame seeds, 
        black sesame seeds, poppy seeds, caraway seeds, and flaky Maldon salt. Add to desired number of bagels just 
        after boiling and right before baking.
      </li>
    </ol>
