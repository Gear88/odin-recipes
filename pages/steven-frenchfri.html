    <h1>Method</h1>
    <h2>French Fries</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by peeling and cutting 1 kilogram of 
        russet potatoes into giant-sized french fries. Place into cool water after peeling and cutting.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the brine, in 1 liter of water add 15 grams of kosher salt, 10 grams of glucose syrup 
        (granulated sugar), and 2 ½ grams of baking soda. Mix together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully add half the fries and half the brine into a vacuumed sealed bag and seal shut. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Add into a 195°F sous vide bath, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and cook for 20 minutes. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Using gloves, carefully remove and drain before carefully placing onto a wire rack set in 
        a rimmed baking sheet. Make sure no fries are touching. Place into the freezer for 30 minutes. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Straight out of the freezer place the fries carefully into 260°F peanut oil for 5-8 minutes 
        until just starting to turn blonde around the edges. Rinse and repeat with the rest in small batches
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the fries back onto the wire rack and into the freezer for at least 2 hours, ideally overnight. 
      </li>
      <li>
        In a saucepot, add 2 quarts of duck fat and heat to 350°F. Carefully add in the fries and let fry 
        between 2-5 minutes until golden brown and crisp. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a giant barbecue needle filled with warm ketchup, slowly insert the needle into the fry 
        lengthwise then slowly remove while filling the fry with ketchup. Rinse and repeat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange the fries on a plate with a sprig of parsley and enjoy. 
      </li>
    </ol>
