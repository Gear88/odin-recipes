      of time making got posesed and tried to eat all of them instead. This recipe is mostly garenteeded to not 
      come alive and try to eat you. (This statement is not legaly binding. We are not responsible if your shanagans
      end up getting your breakfast posesed as well.)

    <h1>Methods</h1>
  
    <h2>Yeasted Waffle</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine flour, cornmeal, sugar, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. Whisk well to combine. 
      </li>
      <li>
        In a smaller bowl, whisk together the eggs and vanilla.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the milk and butter in a small saucepan. Heat until the butter is melted and the 
        mixture has reached 110 °F. Don't worry if there are a few pieces of unmelted butter, 
        just turn off the heat and allow the residual warmth of the milk to melt the last few pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the warmed milk mixture to the dry ingredients and stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the egg mixture and once again, stir to combine. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 1-2 hours or until 
        the mixture has about doubled in volume. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Refrigerate the mixture overnight. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The next morning, preheat your waffle iron and the oven to 300 °F
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the waffles according to the manufacturer's guidelines, about 4-5 minutes on each side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the cooked waffles onto a cooling rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Place the tray 
        into the preheated oven to keep them warm until ready to serve. 
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Maple Caramel Corn Method</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 300 °F. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 300 °F. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat coconut oil in a large pot on medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 2 or 3 kernels, once the kernels pop, add all the remaining kernels. Remove the pot from 
        the heat, cover with a lid, and let sit for 30 seconds. Shake the pot if necessary to make sure 
        all of the kernels come in contact with the hot oil. Return the pot to the heat and once you hear 
        consistent popping, continuously shake the pot until all of the kernels have popped about 3 minutes. 
        Transfer the popcorn to a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the maple syrup, water, butter, and brown sugar in a medium saucepot. Begin heating the 
        mixture over medium-high heat and stir constantly until the butter is melted and the brown sugar is 
        dissolved. Once the mixture is at a boil, stop stirring and continue cooking until the caramel reaches 
        240 °F (115 °C). Add in the baking powder and vanilla extract and mix until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Quickly pour the caramel over the popcorn and fold the mixture with a heat-proof spatula until all the 
        popcorn is coated in caramel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the popcorn to the prepared baking sheet and spread it out into one even layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the popcorn for 10 minutes, then rotate the pan. Continue baking for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the popcorn from the oven and let it cool in the baking sheet for 20-30 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Whipped Cream Method</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine all the ingredients in a medium bowl. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a hand blender, whisk the cream mixture to medium stiff peaks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reserve in the refrigerator until ready to use.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Gourmet Together Breakfast Method</h2>

      <li>
        Stack the yeasted waffles on the serving platter of your choice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with a generous pour of maple syrup, a sprinkling of caramel 
        popcorn, a dollop of whipped cream, and finally, garnish with the strawberry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enjoy.
